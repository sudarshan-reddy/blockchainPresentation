What the Blockchain tries to provide

- Immutability     |
- Validitation     |
- Incentive        |

## What the Blockchain is

An ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without changing proof-of-work

## How a Blockchain should work

<br>

Record Keeping

+++

- Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diana are four peers in a network. 
- Alice has 100 Units. This goes in a block at the top of the chain.
- Alice pays Bob 50 Units, this goes into a new block, and the block is linked to the previous. This is a ledger of sorts.
- How do you keep these records without a central third party?

+++

Validation

- Alice tries to pay Charlie Rs. 75 now. 
- How does everyone know Alice doesn't have the money?
- Bob and Charlie race to validate to see if this is a valid transaction. If it is, the fastest add it to the chain.
- But whats to stop anyone say Bob, from passing a false validation?
- The other nodes will know the transaction that was published and will instantly reject this.

Proof-of-work
